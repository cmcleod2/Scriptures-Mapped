## What I learned from completing project 2
I feel like a lot of what I learned from project 1 was review of things I knew fairly well and then
building some new things on top of that like creating html helpers, using the hash, and the Google
Maps API. This project I felt I was learning a lof of brand new things. I had never used media
queries in css and some of the more advanced selectors and I had never used jQuery at all so learning
to animate those divs took a little while to get the hang of. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot
and I am pleased with the progress I have made in this class.

### 1) Media Queries
After this project I can see how media queries can be really helpful for adapting the site to
different display sizes. I have never really dealt with this before but I can see how powerful it is.
On sites that I have published in the past I have either just disregarded sizing for smaller devices or
I have used a bootstrap template or some other template that did it for me. It is a lot more work to think
about those type of needs but I think they are becoming increasingly important because of how much phones
are ingrained in out society.

### 2) jQuery
I had never really used jQuery much before. If I did it was becasue someone recommended the code to fix a
bug on stack overflow or soemthing like that. It has been interesting to learn about the advantages and
disadvantages of jQuery. I think I prefer trying to do things in vanilla JavaScript becasue I feel like
I have more control but I can see how things like the animations are significantly easier using jQuery.
I have learned the syntax of jQuery and how it can be used to interact with the DOM to inject your code
and dynamically change things.


### 3) Peer Feedback
It was very interesting to ask for feedback from my peers on what I could improve in this project. I asked
my roomates, and some of my coworkers to check out my site and tell me what they think. Most of them seemed
impressed (though obviously they werent going to say many negative things). I think the most common question
was how to navigate back once they got into a certain section. Once I finished and implemented the breadcrumb
though that seemed to fix that problem for the most part. I also go the recommendation to show the map and
content at the same time even on the smaller view port. I incorperated this into my project and made each take
up half the screen on the small viewport.
